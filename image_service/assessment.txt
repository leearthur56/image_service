Technical assessment

Please design and implement an image uploading and display service using Python and
Django. This service offers the following features, all accessible only through REST API:

1. Users can create folder by specifying a folder name.
2. After creating a folder, users can upload images into it.
3. Users can retrieve a list of folders.
4. Users can retrieve a list of images within a folder.
5. For each image, the system should be able to display the image and provide
information, including:
- Image size (width, height)
- Image file size
- Whether itâ€™s a color or grayscale image
- Upload date and time

Please note that using AI assistance to implement the exercise is acceptable, but
ensure you thoroughly understand all the details, as the discussion of this exercise
could be part of a future interview.
